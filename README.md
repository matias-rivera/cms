To install first run the next commands:

```
npm install

```
composer install

these will install all the dependencies.

The next thing it's to create the database on your local database server, which name is **blog**. Use mysql.

After that just need to run the migrations with the command:

```
php artisan migrate --seed
```

The last thing is to set the storage link to the public folder, run the next command:

```
